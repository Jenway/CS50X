Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations...

It looks like both two predictions didn't match the situatiton

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations,'cause 100000+ simulations may cost way too much~
